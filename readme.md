# Avoice Homepage

This project aims to create a webpage for Avoice, an NGO that I have been a part of for several years. The webpage consists of four main sections: Home Page, Who We Are, What Can We Do, and Contact Us. The "What Can We Do" section contains a hidden dropdown menu.

## Usage

Using the Avoice Homepage is straightforward. Simply navigate to the desired section by clicking on the corresponding menu item. The webpage provides information about Avoice, its mission, and the services it offers.

## Configuration

There are no specific configuration options for this project.

## Dependencies

The JavaScript code I provided was referenced from online resources and code examples, and I learned how to create an image slideshow. I cannot provide a link as the code is private and not publicly available.

## License

Free to use the code.
