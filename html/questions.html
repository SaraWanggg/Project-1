        <p><strong>Target Audience and Area</strong></p>
        <p>Launched in 2020 in Belgium. Now conducting volunteering work in 30 countries in Europe, North America, Oceania and Asia. Target audience: Asian women who live and work overseas</p>
        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>As one of the largest and fastest-growing minority groups overseas, Asian women have played an important role in global political, economic, cultural and social development. However, Western society is full of stereotypes about Asian women. The dual identities of “Asian” and “female” make it difficult for them to truly integrate into the mainstream society overseas, and they have long suffered injustice and harm caused by discrimination.</p>
        <p>After the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, overseas Chinese women are facing a severe security crisis and development dilemma. Anti-Asian hate incidents and violence against women have surged in many countries overseas. However, restrictions caused by economic pressure, cultural differences and language barriers, as well as the lack of relief organizations for overseas Asian women, which makes Asian women seek help have to bear greater costs and risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Achievements</strong></p>
        <p>Supporting Asian women across 30 different countries by safeguarding wellbeing and empowering development.</p>
