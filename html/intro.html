            <h2>The Reason We Started</h2>
            <p>After the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, overseas Chinese women are facing a severe security crisis and development dilemma. Anti-Asian hate incidents and violence against women have surged in many countries overseas. However, restrictions caused by economic pressure, cultural differences and language barriers, as well as the lack of relief organizations for overseas Asian women, which makes Asian women seek help have to bear greater costs and risks.</p>
